      <div class="panel">
        <p>Scientists in Germany put on three pop concerts to study the risks of coronavirus infections in large indoor spaces. The three shows were staged Saturday in the eastern city of Leipzig. According to German broadcaster DW News, singer Tim Bendzko volunteered to play all three concerts over the course of the day, to help create a more realistic reaction from the crowd. “We really had a lot of fun,” Bendzko said, according to The Associated Press. “We survived drive-in concerts this summer and in that respect, for us, this is a first step toward normalcy.” The experiment, named Restart-19, was a scientific study carried out by the University Medical Center in Halle. Each show was designed to test a different configuration of the event. One show simulated pre-pandemic conditions; the second added some distance between participants and featured an “optimized hygiene concept,” according to researchers. For the last scenario, concertgoers were asked to maintain 1.5 meters (5 feet) of distance between one another. Participants, who were all healthy and aged between 18 and 50, were asked to wear a face mask throughout the day. They were also equipped with contact tracers, so researchers could record their movement in the packed arena. Fluorescent disinfectants were used to highlight the surfaces that were touched most frequently by audience. Although the project hoped to enlist 4,000 volunteers, only about a third signed up. That’s partially because people are still away for the summer in Germany — and also partially due to fears of taking part in such a large event, according to Stefan Moritz, the experiment’s coordinator. But Moritz, who’s the head of clinical infectious diseases at the university hospital in Halle, added that researchers are “satisfied with the numbers.” “We have good data quality,” he told reporters. The results of the study are expected in four to six weeks, he said.</p>

      <button class="accordion"><h1>Trump claims 'deep state' Food & Drug Administration is delaying coronavirus treatments to hurt his reelection fight</h1></button>
      <div class="panel">
        <p>The president suggested Saturday that his handpicked Food and Drug Administration commissioner is leading a group of “deep state” bureaucrats to delay coronavirus treatments and vaccines to damage his chances of winning reelection.“Obviously, they are hoping to delay the answer until after November 3rd,” Trump tweeted, pointedly tagging FDA Commissioner Dr. Stephen M. Hahn. The president also lashed at the FDA’s decision to revoke its emergency use authorization of hydroxychloroquine, a treatment that Trump has touted. “Many doctors and studies disagree with this!” Trump wrote in response to the news. Hahn didn’t immediately respond to Trump’s criticism. Dr. Anthony Fauci and Dr. Deborah Birx, two of the nation’s top pandemic experts, have also recently been pilloried after they contradicted Trump. The president has been pushing the FDA and other federal agencies to speed up approvals for drugs and possible vaccines for coronavirus. Along with hydroxychloroquine, Trump has also supported an herbal supplement favored by the CEO of My Pillow, Mike Lindell, who is an avid Trump supporter.

      <button class="accordion"><h1>‘Mask-free’ coffee shop in Wisconsin loses lease, will close at the end of month</h1></button>
      <div class="panel">
        <p>A controversial coffee shop in a suburb of Madison, Wis. will close at the end of the month, after failing to renew its lease. Helbachs Coffee Roasters and Kitchen announced on Instagram Thursday that it’s closing its Middleton location on Aug. 31. “This is due to the enforcement actions, negative public statements, and continued vindictive and hostile behavior towards Helbachs Coffee taken by Public Health Madison & Dane County,” the post read. Last month a photo of a sign declaring the coffee shop a “mask free zone” began to circulate online and caught the attention of Dance County officials. The sign, which also asked customers to “please remove mask before entering,” was allegedly seen on July 13 — the same day when a mask ordinance went into effect in Dane County. After the photo went viral, a number of protests took place in front of Helbachs, with demonstrators handing out free coffee to potential customers, hoping to discourage any clients from going in. According to the local Fox-affiliate station WMSN-TV, over the days following the incident, the owner of the cafe denied ever having the sign on its window. Public Health Madison and Dane County issued the coffee shop three citations for violating a public health order. Earlier this month, Helbachs owners sued local officials, arguing that its free speech rights were violated. The suit said that posting the sign was “intended as purely a statement of disagreement with Government policy,” according to The Associated Press. It argued that the sign was only up for 30 minutes, and that the policy was not enforced. In a GoFundMe page set up to raise $50,000 to help with legal funds, owner Casey Helbach explained that the sign was a “misrepresentation of our policy because we have no facial covering (mask) policy,” he wrote. “We believe in freedom of expression and welcome patrons with or without a facial covering (mask),” he added.</p>

      <button class="accordion"><h1>Global coronavirus death toll surges past 800,000 as WHO bets pandemic will end within 2 years</h1></button>
      <div class="panel">
        <p>The number of people killed by coronavirus worldwide climbed past 800,000 on Saturday, according to a tally from Johns Hopkins University. The grim milestone comes less than 24 hours after officials with the World Health Organization said they believe the virus will be under control within two years. The United States has so far reported more COVID-19 deaths than anywhere else in the world. According to the most recent data, 5.6 million Americans have been infected with coronavirus, including more than 175,000 who have succumbed to the disease. Of those, more than 32,000 victims lived in New York, 16,000 in New Jersey and nearly 12,000 in California. California, Texas and Florida have also seen their number of infections and deaths climb in recent weeks. On Saturday, the Sunshine State inched closer to 600,000 cases. Officials believe the true numbers are actually far higher because of a lack of testing and reporting. In the U.S. health officials believe there may be 10 times more cases. Still, schools and businesses nationwide have slowly begun to reopen, sparking concern and debate among citizens. Despite restrictions and social distancing measures, some students and teachers have already become infected amid their return. The U.S. is followed in number of coronavirus case by Brazil, where more than 113,000 people have died from the fast-spreading disease. Worldwide, nearly 23 million people have been infected with COVID-19.</p>

      <button class="accordion"><h1>South Korea orders strict coronavirus restrictions amid spike in new cases</h1></button>
      <div class="panel">
        <p>South Korea is tightening up social distancing measures nationwide, as the country battles with an increase in daily new infections. On Saturday, Health Minister Park Neung-hoo announced new steps to curb the spread of the new coronavirus after 332 new cases were reported by the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The number — the highest daily figure since early March — marks the ninth consecutive day of triple-digit increases. “We are now in a very dangerous situation that could trigger a massive nationwide spread of COVID-19,” Park said, according to The Associated Press. Asia’s fourth-largest economy was widely praised by the global community for its early efforts in bringing the epidemic under control, through advanced contact tracing and widespread testing. But recent outbreaks, mostly reported in the Seoul metropolitan area, have raised fears of a second wave of infections. Last week, coronavirus restrictions were implemented in the Seoul region; but they have now been expanded to the rest of the country. According to the new restrictions, health officials have ordered the closing of entertainment venues — including clubs, karaoke bars, buffet restaurant cafes — and banned spectators from sporting events. Churches, a major source of recent outbreaks, as well as beaches, will also be closed, according to the AP. Stricter measures — such as limiting gatherings to no more than people, and cancelling sports events — could still be implemented, if there’s no sign of a slowing down of the spread, Korea CDC Director Jeong Eun-kyeong said. South Korea’s national caseload is now at 17,002, including 309 deaths.</p>
